# YogaBoss
Yoga Boss is a website landing page for a yoga class, targeting beginners to yoga. From this page users will be shown a beginners guide which they can start at home. And also a youtube video which explains the benefits of starting yoga.

At the bottom of this page I included a sign up form for users. As the next step in their yoga jounrey.
